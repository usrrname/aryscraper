Elementary scrapers
============
I have a fascination with WW2 history and how evil people may get into power.
This is a silly exercise to:
- [x] scrape the names of the SS high command from the Wikipedia page `scrape-ss-names.py`
- [x] use them to create folders `create-named-folders.py`
- [ ] search the web and scrape images of their faces.
