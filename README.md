Elementary scrapers
============

Run virtualenv
`source ./venv/bin/activate`

I have a fascination with WW2 history and how evil people may get into power.
This is a silly exercise to:
- [x] scrape the names of the SS high command from the Wikipedia page `scrape-ss-names.py`
- [x] use them to create folders `create-named-folders.py`
- [x] finds portraits of their faces with serpapi/google search image api `image-scraper.py`
- [x] stores the scraped images in AWS S3 instead of saving them on github which is not an optimal storage solution for bins
